  <p><strong>Ingredient Storage:</strong> Always check the expiration dates on all ingredients before use. 
    Store dry goods like flour, sugar, and rice in airtight containers to prevent moisture and pests. 
    For fresh produce, store leafy greens in a sealed bag with a paper towel to absorb excess moisture, 
    which helps them stay fresh longer.</p>

  <p><strong>Cooking Temperature Tips:</strong> For meats, always check the internal temperature with a 
    thermometer to ensure safety. Poultry should reach 165°F (74°C), beef steaks and roasts vary depending 
    on preference, but ground meat should reach 160°F (71°C). Vegetables are often best cooked al dente to 
    preserve nutrients and texture.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Meal Prep Advice:</strong> Plan your meals ahead of time to save both money and time. Wash and 
    chop vegetables in bulk and store them in airtight containers. Marinate proteins overnight for better flavor. 
    Use labeled containers to avoid confusion during the week.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Pantry Essentials:</strong> Keep your pantry stocked with basics like olive oil, salt, pepper, 
    garlic, onions, canned tomatoes, beans, and rice. These ingredients form the foundation of countless meals. 
    Also, keep a variety of spices to add depth and flavor to your dishes without needing complicated sauces.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Safety Precautions:</strong> Never leave cooking food unattended. Keep a fire extinguisher nearby, 
    and know how to use it. Avoid loose clothing while cooking, and tie back long hair. Always turn pot handles 
    inward to prevent accidental spills, and wipe up any spills immediately to avoid slips.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Cleaning Tips:</strong> Clean as you go. Wash cutting boards and knives immediately after use, 
    especially after handling raw meat. Use separate boards for meats and vegetables to avoid cross-contamination. 
    Keep countertops wiped and sanitized, and make sure to take out the trash regularly to maintain a hygienic workspace.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Baking Tips:</strong> Measure ingredients carefully; baking is a science. Use room-temperature eggs 
    and dairy for better mixing. Preheat your oven thoroughly, and rotate baking trays halfway through cooking for 
    even results. Don’t open the oven door too often, or it can affect rising and baking times.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Extra Flavor:</strong> Use fresh herbs, lemon juice, or a pinch of zest to brighten dishes. 
    Toast spices briefly in a dry pan to release aromas. Salt gradually, tasting as you go, to avoid over-seasoning. 
    Incorporate acidic ingredients like vinegar or citrus at the end of cooking to enhance flavor.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Have Fun:</strong> Enjoy the process! Cooking is an art and a science. Play music, 
    experiment with new ingredients, and taste as you go. Remember that mistakes happen; even burnt toast can be a 
    learning experience. Stay patient, organized, and curious.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Sustainability Tips:</strong> Compost vegetable scraps when possible. Reduce food waste by planning 
    meals and using leftovers creatively. Reuse containers and glass jars for storage. Buy local ingredients when 
    available to support community farmers and reduce carbon footprint.</p>
