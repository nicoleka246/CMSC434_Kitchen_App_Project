  <p><strong>1.</strong> Peel ginger with a spoon.</p>
  <p><strong>2.</strong> For meats, always check the internal temperature with a 
    thermometer to ensure safety. Poultry should reach 165°F (74°C), beef steaks and roasts vary depending 
    on preference, but ground meat should reach 160°F (71°C).</p>
  <p><strong>3.</strong> Plan your meals ahead of time to save both money and time.</p>
  <p><strong>4.</strong> Use a sharp knife for better precision and safety. A dull knife requires more force, 
    increasing the risk of slipping and cutting yourself</p>
  <p><strong>5.</strong> When baking, always preheat your oven to the correct temperature before placing your dish inside and
    don’t open the oven door too often or it can affect rising and baking times..</p>
  <p><strong>6.</strong> To prevent food waste, store leftovers in clear containers and label them with the date.</p>
  <p><strong>7.</strong> Keep your pantry stocked with basics like olive oil, salt, pepper, 
    garlic, onions, canned tomatoes, beans, and rice.</p>
  <p><strong>8.</strong> Never leave cooking food unattended. Keep a fire extinguisher nearby, 
    and know how to use it.</p>
  <p><strong>9.</strong> Avoid loose clothing while cooking, and tie back long hair.</p>
  <p><strong>10.</strong> Clean as you go. Wash cutting boards and knives immediately after use, 
    especially after handling raw meat.</p>
  <p><strong>11.</strong> Salt gradually, tasting as you go, to avoid over-seasoning. </p>
  <p><strong>12.</strong> Use fresh herbs, lemon juice, or a pinch of zest to brighten dishes. 
    Toast spices briefly in a dry pan to release aromas.</p>
  <p><strong>13.</strong> Enjoy the process! Play music, experiment with new ingredients, and taste as you go. Remember that mistakes happen; even burnt toast can be a 
    learning experience.</p>
  <p><strong>14.</strong> Reduce food waste by planning meals and using leftovers creatively.</p>
  <p><strong>15.</strong> Freeze items for later use! And as flat as possible.</p>
  <p><strong>16.</strong> Defrost meat on aluminum trays.</p>
  <p><strong>17.</strong> Read the recipe first.</p>
  <p><strong>18.</strong> Use a scale for baking.</p>
